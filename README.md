# Rizfolio

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website, Rizfolio. It's a simple, single-page application (SPA) built with vanilla JavaScript, Node.js, and Markdown.

## Features

*   **Single-Page Application (SPA):** The website is built as an SPA, which means that it loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user navigates through the site. This provides a fast and smooth user experience.
*   **Blog with Markdown:** The blog posts are written in Markdown and are dynamically rendered on the frontend. This makes it easy to write and manage blog content.
*   **Simple Node.js Backend:** The backend is a simple Node.js server that serves the static files and provides a basic API for fetching blog posts.

## Tech Stack

*   **Frontend:** Vanilla JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Marked.js
*   **Backend:** Node.js
